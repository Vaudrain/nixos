# Vaud NixOS Setup

In progress personal NixOS setup, slowly maturing.

Flake based setup - currently only one host (desktop), but planning to expand to my laptop in futurre.
Running with a base nixpkgs 24.05 for plasma compatability reasons - all other packages managed via unstable
Manually updated nvidia driver at current.

If you stumble across this and have any questions, feel free to get in touch!

## To Do

- Laptop host
